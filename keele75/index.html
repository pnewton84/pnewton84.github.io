John did a tremendous amount to look after the estate and was a key figure in facilitating the setting up of the arboretum and the National Collection of Flowering Cherries. John represented so much of Keele, both campus and village - he was on the parish council and there's now a stone in his memory at the entrance to Hawthorns.

							<h2>John Kolbert</h2>
							<span class="text-container"><p>John is well-known for publishing a popular history of Keele's first half-century, and his concise history of Keele Hall sold 25,000 copies. In 1965 John applied for the post of assistant in the registry at Keele. While at  the University, he organised concerts that attracted international stars including the mezzo-soprano Dame Janet Baker and the virtuoso violinist Ruggiero Ricci. His wife, Mary, was a Senior Lecturer in Biology at the University.</p></span>

							<h2>Gladys Malbon</h2>
							<span class="text-container"><p>Gladys Malbon, Secretary of the North Staffordshire Workers’ Education Association, played an important role in the creation of the University College of North Staffordshire, now Keele University. After the Second World War, much of the thrust behind the campaign to create a university in the area came from the group.  She was involved in drafting the original Charter and alongside Lord Lindsay and Alderman Horwood, she argued for the university during a crucial meeting in 1949 that brought the universities of Birmingham and Manchester to join with Oxford in sponsoring the new university. Gladys continued to serve Keele as a member of the Court of Governors. For her enthusiasm and contribution, she was awarded an honorary degree at Keele in 1966.</p></span>

							<h2>Ronald Frankenberg</h2>
							<span class="text-container"><p>Ronnie, as he was universally and affectionately known, was appointed inaugural Professor of Sociology at Keele in 1969, and helped make it one of the leading departments in Britain. He used his authority to build a genuinely joint department of anthropologists and sociologists, and was inspired by the student protests of the period to develop the innovative workshop seminar system. It helped make Keele a pioneer in key areas of research in science and technology studies, in visual culture, and in the sociology of time. By the time Ronnie died in 2015, he was one of most widely acknowledged figures in British social anthropology.</p></span>

							<h2>Marion Bailey</h2>
							<span class="text-container"><p>Marion was a secretary in Stoke Town Hall when in 1949 she was appointed as the first employee of the University College of North Staffordshire, which took its first students in 1950. She was Secretary to Lord Lindsay and was subsequently Secretary to all three Registrars. In 1977 she was awarded the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Medal for Service to the University. She was awarded an honorary degree in 1996 for being a partner in the creation of Keele. Marion donated a group of White Poplars Populus alba on the grass by the Chapel and Walter Moberly Hall, close to where her office in the Registry had stood for over 30 years. There is one remaining.</p></span>
